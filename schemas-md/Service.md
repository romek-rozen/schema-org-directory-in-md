| Properties from [Service](https://schema.org/Service "Service") |

| ``` areaServed ``` | [AdministrativeArea](https://schema.org/AdministrativeArea "AdministrativeArea") or [GeoShape](https://schema.org/GeoShape "GeoShape") or [Place](https://schema.org/Place "Place") or [Text](https://schema.org/Text "Text") | The geographic area where a service or offered item is provided. Supersedes [serviceArea](https://schema.org/serviceArea "serviceArea"). |
| ``` audience ``` | [Audience](https://schema.org/Audience "Audience") | An intended audience, i.e. a group for whom something was created. Supersedes [serviceAudience](https://schema.org/serviceAudience "serviceAudience"). |

| ``` broker ``` | [Organization](https://schema.org/Organization "Organization") or [Person](https://schema.org/Person "Person") | An entity that arranges for an exchange between a buyer and a seller.

Greater signs or slashes can be used to informally indicate a category hierarchy. |
| ``` hasCertification ``` | [Certification](https://schema.org/Certification "Certification") | Certification information about a product, organization, service, place, or person. |

Use [businessFunction](https://schema.org/businessFunction) to indicate the kind of transaction offered, i.e. sell, lease, etc. This property can also be used to describe a [Demand](https://schema.org/Demand). While this property is listed as expected on a number of common types, it can be used in others. In that case, using a second type, such as Product or a subtype of Product, can clarify the nature of the offer. Inverse property: [itemOffered](https://schema.org/itemOffered "itemOffered") |
| ``` provider ``` | [Organization](https://schema.org/Organization "Organization") or [Person](https://schema.org/Person "Person") | The service provider, service operator, or service performer; the goods producer.

| ``` additionalType ``` | [Text](https://schema.org/Text "Text") or [URL](https://schema.org/URL "URL") | An additional type for the item, typically used for adding more specific types from external vocabularies in microdata syntax. This is a relationship between something and a class that the thing is in. Typically the value is a URI-identified RDF class, and in this case corresponds to the use of rdf:type in RDF. Text values can be used sparingly, for cases where useful information can be added without their being an appropriate schema to reference. In the case of text values, the class label should follow the schema.org [style guide](https://schema.org/docs/styleguide.html). |
| ``` alternateName ``` | [Text](https://schema.org/Text "Text") | An alias for the item. |
| ``` description ``` | [Text](https://schema.org/Text "Text") or [TextObject](https://schema.org/TextObject "TextObject") | A description of the item. |
| ``` disambiguatingDescription ``` | [Text](https://schema.org/Text "Text") | A sub property of description. A short description of the item used to disambiguate from other, similar items. Information from other properties (in particular, name) may be necessary for the description to be useful for disambiguation. |

See [background notes](https://schema.org/docs/datamodel.html#identifierBg) for more details. |
| ``` image ``` | [ImageObject](https://schema.org/ImageObject "ImageObject") or [URL](https://schema.org/URL "URL") | An image of the item. This can be a [URL](https://schema.org/URL) or a fully described [ImageObject](https://schema.org/ImageObject). |
| ``` mainEntityOfPage ``` | [CreativeWork](https://schema.org/CreativeWork "CreativeWork") or [URL](https://schema.org/URL "URL") | Indicates a page (or other CreativeWork) for which this thing is the main entity being described. See [background notes](https://schema.org/docs/datamodel.html#mainEntityBackground) for details. Inverse property: [mainEntity](https://schema.org/mainEntity "mainEntity") |
| ``` name ``` | [Text](https://schema.org/Text "Text") | The name of the item. |
